1.1.0-major
Suggested (Should update as major changes have happened)

💗 To You all!

- FIXED Blue Skies (thx @JCOverAll for the github issue)
- This update was suppose to be a bigger update, but I really
    did not want to have blueskies not working.
- Again, any feedback is appreciated (good or bad)!
   - GitHub Issues/Comments on the original post work!
        (Please do link mods if it is an issue
        with one)

- I do generally appreciate all the recent downloads! TYSM!
- I might make a discord if you guys want it.

Anyways,

- 1.1.0 Major Update -

! CHANGE
- Screenshots Instead Of Set Name/Set Author
 - Set Name / Set Author Can Now Be Changed By
    Clicking The Title / Subtitle

- Fixed background cover select for default covers
- Fixed custom exe not being listed
- Made Snowflakes Rotate Whilst Falling
- Squircles!
- Image Viewer
- Preload immediately visible screenshots and all covers
    - WebWorker/Async for other images to save on ram

Remember, if you have bugs, issues, or questions,
create a git issue or put a comment under
the original post!
