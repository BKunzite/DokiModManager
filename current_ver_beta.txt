1.0.3-beta
OPTIONAL

Ive got some motivation back to update
This is mostly a minor update
including a Christmas theme (hence the version)
and fixes a few mods

💗 To You all!

- Christmas theme
 - Snowflakes
 - Christmas Jingle
 - Present Loading Animation
- Fixed Certain Mods
 - Mostly Club Meetings
   - (Fixed the issue of some mods
      requiring scripts.rpa to be
      deleted whilst trying not to
      break the ones that don't need
      it to be deleted)

- Future -
 - The christmas theme will be disabled
   come January
