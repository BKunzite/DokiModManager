1.0.2-beta
Please update to this update so ik people still use this!
I'm kinda disappointed with how things turned out, but oh well.
I will continue updates, but im a little demotivated so
after this update, most of them will probably be bug fixes.
I use this often, so I might add a thing or two every so often
because I find it usefull.
I spent months on this project just for a handfull of downloads, and I
kinda hoped for more; I am still thankfull for each one of you who
downloaded it!

💗 To You all!
