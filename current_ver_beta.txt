1.0.5-beta-semimajor
OPTIONAL

Ive got some motivation back to update
This is mostly a minor update
including a Christmas theme (hence the version)
and fixes a few mods

💗 To You all!

- Fixed background cover select for default covers
- Fixed custom exe not being listed
- Made Snowflakes Rotate Whilst Falling
- Squircles!
- Screenshots Instead Of Set Name/Set Author
 - Set Name / Set Author Can Now Be Changed By
    Clicking The Title / Subtitle

Remember, if you have bugs, issues, or questions,
create a git issue or put a comment under
the original post!
